# SimpleFluidSim

This project is a simulation Kármán vortex street.
An earlier project was done with Martha Kalmar using MATLAB.
This version is made in C++ to perform the main calculation, then it use Python with Matplotlib and Numpy to visualize the result.

For now, to visualize the result, you need to compile and run main.cpp and then execute main.py or just open currentResult.png wich is in the main directory of the repository.
