This project is a simulation Kármán vortex street.
An earlier project was done with M. Kalmar using MATLAB.
This version is made in C++ to perform the main calculation, then it use Python with Matplotlib and Numpy to visualize the result.

For now, to visualize the result, you need to compile and run main.cpp and then execute main.py
